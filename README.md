# Helpdesk
 This app allows an User to manage help desk tickets that come in from Students.


## Pitch:

 Â As a Students , I need a place where I can escalate a concerns and receive help. <br>  
 This app allows an admin to manage help desk tickets that come in from Students. <br>
 It also allows students (A 2nd user type) to submit a help desk ticket, categorize it and post it to the help channel.

### MVP

As a student I want to log in and have the ability to see tickets that are currently open for help. As a student I want to be able to create a new help ticket with a title, description, what I've tried and a category (i.e. React). 

As a helper I want to be able to login and see a list of open tickets. As a helper I want to be able to assign a ticket to myself by clicking a "help student" button. As a helper I want to be able to mark the ticket as "resolved", or re-assign the ticket back to the queue if I cannot resolve the ticket.
Stretch: Build an integrated slack-bot that allows students to submit help tickets through slack. Allow the ability to subscribe to the Queue in slack to be notified if someone opens a ticket.
